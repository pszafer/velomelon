Spontaneously, we packed up and started our journey to Nadwarcianski National Park( a brethtaking area by the Warta [varta] river. 260 kilometers of joy :) We left our city Poznan and went through Kórnik, passed neogothic Kórnik castle.. aiming to get to the nature. It was amazing being outdoors for a few days after winter. The call of wilderness was in the air, storks had come back to our country and everythnig around us was blooming and we were reborn ;) A vast amount of energy was injected.
