Mother Nature, what the hell have they done to you? They've made a parking lot out of the park. As cyclists we experienced hell rather than pleasure riding in Yellowstone. Car after car, RV after RV, and it was just second half of May. But what should I expect? If there is a parking lot next to every "attraction" of the park, if it is cheaper to go by car than to walk in or go by bike... and (I quote a ranger) "Every year we have a bunch of dead hikers and bikers caused by inexperienced RV's drivers" so the best option is to stay in the car. I would not be surprised if in the future they'll put a sign "no bikes allowed".
There is no place for cyclists there. There is no option to be Eco-friendly visitor. There is no place for direct contact with the nature. Everything is urbanized. When we got to Old Faithful we saw another parking lot, enormous visitor center... but wait, where is the geyser? Ohh it's behind the building. Somebody designed it in a very special way. You can see the geyser through a huge window. To me it looked like a fountain surrounded by concrete pavement and all this buildings on the left and on the right.

One of the most beautiful places, though, was
West Thumb Geyser Basin

Grand Prismatic Spring was difficult to be seen because of the steam but it was spectacular.

To Mammoth Hot Springs the road was even more dangerous with no shoulder, abyss on the right and a lot of road work.

To Yellowstone we entered from the southern part. Firstly, we went through Grand Teton which spoiled us with bike lane and modest human changes. But in Yellowstone it was hazardous biking. We planned to stay about 5 days in the park but we stayed only two. A park ranger highly recommended leaving the park. We agreed doubtlessly. Last day it was snowing all night and day so we didn't see bright future for us there anyway.
