We have met an amazing woman with skills to fly :) Her name is Mimi and she is one of those who say "don't waste your time, do it" :) She took us very high to experience what is like being a bird and now biking seems boring... Anyway, we were very excited and couldn't believe it when she said "Do you want to fly?"

We flew above Edenton on Albemarle Sound in Chowan County and Williamston in Martin County. Everything was so tiny and small. The earth looks like patchwork cloth. Thanks Mimi! we will never forget what you shared with us.
