Before we got to this amazing city we had some adventures at the airport in Miami. I couldn't believe this woman in check-in gate that we have to have a return ticket if going to Argentina. I almost passed out then I said "Are you joking" and then "I'd like to speak to supervisor" Another woman came and said the same. I said "We don't need a return ticket because we travel by bike" and she made that weird face at us. After 30 minutes we solved the problem giving our card number so they can check if we have money for return ticket ;) After long, long journey we had to speak to officer at BA airport. He asked about hotel address so we gave him the address of our warmshower friend but it was only the name of city so that man decided to call Martin on our cost. Fortunately, Martin confirmed our stay and we went to get our bikes. Oh noooo, they were inspected and box was torn but no damages. Yupi! :)

Martin was a great guide around Buenos Aires. On our bicicletas we went through the most beautiful places in Buenos. We met Messi and Pope ;) and ate most delicious Argentinian Empanadas that it's considered as fast food in Buenos but it tastes like heaven and it's with olives :))) Old and new buildings were ornamented with spring blooming violet trees but La Boca ones were so colorful that it felt like in the dream. Great place to have a party!!! Check out photos and short movie of buenas streets.
