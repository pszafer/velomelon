Let me introduce you an abandoned place that was a prison for Polish, German, Russian and French military prisoners. After the Second World War Russians built some blocks of flats, a hospital, shops and even a cinama:) In the early nineties they left leaving everything behind. I don't want to go into details but in this city could live about 5 000 people, however nowadays only twelve inhabitants liveÂ in one of those blocks. I was suprised that someone actually wants to live there among debris and ghosts. Bravo for them.

Not far away there is a spectacular Russian cementary with an eye-catching tommy-gun and teddies on the graves.
