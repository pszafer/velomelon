We loved so funny company of Peruvian kids. We spent many evenings with them when camping somewhere in small towns. That time we camped on a football pitch. They were interested in everything we did. When Paul was starting fire to cook some rice (they thought we were primitive people and also were wandering why we ate only rice. Disgusted they went home :) Unfortunately, we didn't have any sweets for them.
