During our trip we've met a lot of great people. We discussed with them our plans and learned what else we would like to visit.
Some people were in South America and talked a lot about weather in Patagonia, Argentina, rain forests etc. Everybody said that we should also visit west part of USA because it is a lot more interesting than south Texas, so we must visit Yellowstone and Grand Canyon :)

So from December you can visit Argentina with us and a lot of places in South America :)
