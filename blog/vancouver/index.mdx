There is so much to do in Vancouver! If you like doing sports it's the best place to live. It is heaven for those who like outdoor activities. Beaches, water, mountains, islands, it's just beautiful! We meet there many fantastic people who showed us the best places there. In general I loved every park in Vancouver. It's so wild with huge trees and many paths to walk and bike. The very second you enter the park you will feel far far away from the town. 
My favorite was Lighthouse Park. Many gigantic trees and beautiful rocky coast. It's breathtaking.

We also enjoyed Grouse Mountain but we did not hike there because of my injured knees. I had an accident when riding through wet rail road crossing, My rear wheel slipped on it and I fell. Ouch! Almost passed out when I saw blood but I manged to escape from oncoming traffic.
Our friend Mirek took us via round-trip Skyride. At the peak of Vancouver we saw many beautiful views, rescued grizzly bears and lumberjack show which was very funny!

The most spectacular sunset we saw on Wreck Beach. Not just because of naked people who are sunbathing there ;) , but because of mountains, birds, trees and rocks.
