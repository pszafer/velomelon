Lake District day three, the most beautiful views ever. We left the famous ruta 40 and took 65. It was gravel road with very steep climb but definitely it was worth it. Riding along Lake Traful we didn't meet any crazy bikers that would go this hard road... but it was super easy to find spot for camping and waves of the lake were the only lullaby to us. It was awesome.
