Surreal or sculptured abyss... My vocabulary is too poor to describe Grand Canyon. This video and photos will show some of its greatness and beauty. We visited it on Easter in April 2017. We took road 64 from Williams and camped in national forest before we got the park. The next day we road along the South Rim to Hermit's Rest and back and then to Desert View but we were too tired to get to the top of the tower... or lazy :)

We still had to leave the park to find some place for our little home.
