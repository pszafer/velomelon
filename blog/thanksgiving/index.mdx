This was our first Thanksgiving and it was awesome. We were just about to leave US so we had a good break from packing up our bikes and stuff into these small boxes. Anyway, Vence and Tommie were so supportive that it wasn't that difficult to do it. The atmosphere was very nice, we had so very wonderful time and met many fantastic people. The Wingfield family welcomed us like we were one of theirs and it was very moving. We prepared Polish meal, gołąbki, for dinner and they liked it (I hope so). After big feast we went to the beach to breath some breeze from Atlantic Ocean. It was beautiful. Day after Thanksgiving we went to Gumbo Limbo Environmental Complex to see how they look after little turtles and do research. It was great. Many, many good memories from Boca Raton!
