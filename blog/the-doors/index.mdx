Being in LA I couldn't miss some places that have belonged to The Doors and Jim Morrison.
The concert in Hollywood Bowl was my first experience with this band, so we went there to see the scene. I thought it was much bigger. We could go around it with our bikes :) We visited the museum of Hollywood Bowl as well.

We met the Lizard on the platform :)

The story of the Doors begun on Venice Beach where Jim and Ray met by accident and had serious conversation about plans for the future. Jim admitted that he wrote some lyrics and presented some verses to Ray. He was amused by them and I invited Jim to his band...

As The Doors they started playing in London Fog but the performances in nearby club Whisky-a-Go-Go brought them real popularity. Jim didn't try to behave when he was on the scene and when he came up with new lyrics that he added to the song The End about mother and father, he crossed the line and they were kicked out of the club.

On the same street, Sunset Boulevard, there is Chateau Marmont, a luxurious hotel that Jim used to live.

And not far away from the hotel, there is an empty old building that was a studio where Doors recorded their last album L.A. Woman released in April 1971, 3 months before Jim's death.

Everything took place so long ago (I wasn't even born) but the music and Jim's poetry remain forever. I think that many people will take the same trip as we did. We are so glad that we could be at the concert when Ray Manzarek (whose parents were Polish) and Robby Krieger came to Poland. It was an amazing and magical concert. When they played Riders On The Storm it was actually raining. We couldn't stop dancing and people behind us who were sitting threw dirt at us, tried to make us sit down...
