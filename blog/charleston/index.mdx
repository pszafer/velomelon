In South Carolina we had opportunity to go through the national forest and it was so veeeeery pleasant ride. In Poland you can enter any forest you like because they are all national but in USA we have been seeing NO TRESPASSING all the time. We feel like there is no nature available in this country so we were very happy to visit woods for the first time after thousand miles. The road in the forest was very smooth an we really enjoyed every minute in Francis Marion National Forest.

And then an enormous cable-stayed bridge appeared that leads to Charleston, the oldest city in South Carolina. Fortunately, it has a bike lane so I could stop and take a nice shot of waving flag over the Cooper River in the sunset.

The next day we went sightseeing to the first settlement in Charles Towne. The place is situated in marsh park with many spectacular old oaks (one of them is about 700 years old), swamps and gardens. Charles Towne Landing is bike friendly so you can visit the place easily and quickly. Following the historical trail you learn many interesting facts about the first colonists and natives; what did they grow or what games the played, how they helped each other and so on. There was also an amazing replica ship that was sailing in the 17th century between Charles Towne and New York called The Adventure. It carried goods like sugar, rum, juice or iron. It is compared to mid-size delivery truck. I'm sure there are more things to see in Charleston because it is a very interesting and historical city.
Afterwards we went to look for some fried fresh shrimps but the place I had picked up was closed... like others because it was Monday :(
