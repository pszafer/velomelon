Sequoias are one of the largest and oldest trees in the world. These massive trees can live over 3,000 years (when most trees are 300 years old) thanks to a chemical in the bark called tannin that helps protect them from rot and insects.
Fibrous and thick bark protects them from fire.

These gorgeous trees can grow as high as a 26-story building, with an average height of 50 to 70 meters. The most famous inhabitant of the Sequoia National Park, General Sherman's tree is almost 83 meters high and over 11 meters in diameter, making it the largest tree in the world by volume. Looking at it can be compared to looking at a human being 180 cm from the perspective of a mouse. The tree is said to be around 2,200 years old.
The most interesting fact, however, is that these trees, or at least most of them, owed their life to fire. Yes, itâ€™s true. Redwoods need fire as much as water. The heat from low-intensity fires allows the redwood cones to open up and drop seeds the size of an oatmeal onto a fresh layer of ash, which is their best substrate. Additionally, the fire destroys fungi and insects that could harm trees. It is easy to guess that it also destroys trees, but the younger ones, which on the one hand is a good treatment because competition is reduced. Since 1960, the park's service has "organized" controlled burning of the mulch to help redwoods and burn off excess forest debris. Failure to do so could cause a serious fire that would damage even older trees.
The stay in the park was a great experience.
To this day, I dream of their huge crowns.
Sometimes personified as characters in books about The Lord of the Rings - Ents. I love looking at old oaks, but when I think about redwoods, it gives me shivers.
