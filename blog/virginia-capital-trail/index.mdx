Last time we had a chance to ride along Virginia Capital Trail and we really enjoyed it. It was fun :) The trail is prepared perfectly for biking and it goes through peaceful, green areas. Wonderful ride for about 55 miles and there are a lot of things to see and visit. It was a nice day, the weather was perfect, it was sunny and warm. We went from Richmond to Williamsburg and then to Jamestown. There is a video of riding along Virginia Capital Trail the best bike lane ever :). 
The next post will be about visiting Williamsburg.
