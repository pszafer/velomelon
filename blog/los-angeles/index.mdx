Bikers! You have to be careful and watch out for Edward Scissorhands. In LA we arrived about 9 am. We were very excited about biking in this famous town. Once we set up our bikes we hit the road. We went to Hollywood hills to see the panoramic view of town. It was awesome!!! Then we looked for an old amphitheater called Hollywood Bowl. We could ride to the front of its scene where the Doors once played <3 The walk of fame was also entertaining. We saw Jack Sparrow, Freddie Kruger and Edward Scissorhands who cut my hair and... a tire :( We ended up in Venice Beach. The beach of the Doors beginning...
