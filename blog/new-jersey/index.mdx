Is New Jersey a garden state? really?- I was wondering riding through messy roads and ugly industrial buildings. The trip from NYC to New Jersey was not as bike friendly as we thought. We had to go across Manhattan until we got to Harlem to cross the Hudson river. George Washington bridge is beautiful, though, and the view from is incredible. The ride in New Jersey was very exhausting but it was worth it because we met fantastic people, Rachelle and Fred, there. They welcomed us in their beautiful house with a wonderful garden. We found out that there are some nice places in the state but unfortunately they weren't on our way. Here's a short video of our cycling.
