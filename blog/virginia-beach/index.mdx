Virginia Beach has beautiful wide sandy beach but in the center the huge hotels eclipse the sun so we couldn't sunbathe at about 5 pm ;) Anyway, we found a great empty beach on the southern side of &nbsp;Virginia Beach where there were some spectacular houses built on dunes (lucky b.... ones;)&nbsp;

The weather was perfect and water was surprisingly warm about 20 Celsius. We couldn't swim because the waves were so huge that I thought they were gonna take me back to Europe ;)

Nice watching :)
