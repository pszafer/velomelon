What was our journey through Patagonia like? We prepared a few episodes of our adventure and wild life in Patagonia. This is the first day of it. We went from Dina Huapi towards Villa la Angostura. It was a very windy day so our speed was about 14 km/h, and the trucks were pushing us out of the road, and sand was blinding us... but we had a very simple plan :) Check it out :) <strong>You can switch on subtitles on youtube player.</strong>
