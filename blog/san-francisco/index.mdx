The most beautiful city in United States so far. We were inspired by its architecture and hilly roads :)  Sometimes it was so steep that I had to pedal verrry hard and it took my breath away. We didn't look look for tourists attractions, just rode along the bay admiring Golden Gate Bridge. It's really outstanding.

It was a pleasant ride, not much traffic and many bike lanes. Than we got to Haight-Ashbury that used to be hippie district. 
I just wanted to take a look at one building there where a very special singer once lived...
