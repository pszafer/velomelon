We spent a few days in Seattle.
The most iconic attraction and icon of the city is the futuristic 184 meter high tower Space Needle. We rested on the lawn under the tower, which was the backdrop for the colorful amphitheater, where in 1991 Pearl Jam played their first album. The scene practically did not change.

After half a year, we managed to meet a couple from Florida: Tom and Becky, who continued their annual tradition by cycling along the Pacific coast. We sat together and spent some time talking. We persuaded them to travel to South America, but their expressions showed that they definitely prefer to go around their country.

Another famous place I definitely wanted to see in the city was the music club where young grunge bands were taking their first steps. The live song Love, Hate, Love by Alice in Chains, which I love, was shot at the Moore Theater. Unfortunately, I could only enjoy it from the outside because it was closed.
Tourists, however, rave about other places in the city, such as the public bazaar.

We also went there. Pike Place Market is located right on Elliot Bay, so you mainly go there for fresh seafood and fish. We just bought fresh donuts there, old whiskey and we headed towards the long-awaited lantern from the Hunger Strike clip. The path led through the beautiful huge Discovery Park.
Leaving Seattle, we drove to see the little Viretta Park, which is just south of Kurt Cobain's former home. The park looked more like a small green square with a few trees and scuffed benches. Nirvana fans gather there on the anniversary of Cobain's death to pay tribute to him. The wooden benches, which are in fact a monument to the singer, are covered with inscriptions pointing to the rock icon. There were also flowers in a vase from a bollard. We left our thoughts there and headed to our last destination - Vancouver.
