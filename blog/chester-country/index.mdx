We had a great time in Marshallton last week thanks to Rob and his family. Inspite of bad weather he took us for a ride along country roads. The landscape is beautiful there with many horses and barns, nice houses we finally find some nature. We rode many miles that day, it was rainy and windy but we carried on. Check out our little adventure :)

Rob and his wife Kerrie helped us to find other places to stay in their family's homes so the next day we went to Odessa and saw an old house with amazing wooden furniture and the next day we rode to Queenstown, a beautiful place to stay forever. We have met fantastic people and animals too :) Another day we hichhiked with our bikes on the truck across the Chester river and we rode form there to Washington. What a journey !!! It wouldn't be without you :)
