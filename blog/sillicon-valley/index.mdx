We were a few days before San Francisco, almost ready to reach it. We had to choose between riding across the ocean or pass the mountains to San Jose and visit Silicon Valley, one of the most famous places of modern electronics, places of main offices of Apple, Google, Intel etc.. We were pretty sick of the ocean so decided to go the second way. We wanted to see the place which is supposed to be one of the best place to work and very expensive at the same time.
We started our trip visiting Intel campus. Intel prepared great place for tourists, museum of Intel history. It was pretty cool to see how processors have evolved during years and how those are manufactured, really impressive.
Next place we visited or more to say pass through was Apple campus. Nothing really interesting. Just regular iStore and that's it. We rode north along San Francisco peninsula and reached Google campus. Google is little better than Apple, they prepared Android Park for tourists, but visitor center is only possible to see with Google employee... So we saw all logos of Android, Google bicycles and that's all. Intel spoiled us a little bit. Last point was to visit birth place of Silicon Valley, HP Garage. Building is pretty cool, located in old neighborhood. There is a board in memory of this event.
And that's all. It was cool to see how Silicon Valley looks like, but really it is still only business centre, not prepared to show for tourists. Maybe in a few years...
