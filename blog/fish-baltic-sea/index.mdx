Wouldn't you like to try a fresh fishy cod or smoked one? It's possible if you come here to Unieście. In May 2016 we went there to travel around for 3 days and it was amazing. On the first day we cycled to Dąbki, another small beautiful town with nice clean beaches and the Bukowo Lake lying opposite the sea. One-way we rode along the road of the southern part of the lake and on the way back we tried to cross from Dąbkowice to Łazy but it was impossible. The "Great" Maritime Office closed the road and we had to push our bikes for about 5 km. I could have done even more anyway, because my bike looked like a bike made of sand.
Near Unieście, aiming to the west, there is a small cute village Chłopy where you can also buy some delicious fish. From there you can go to visit the lighthouse in Gąski from which you can see the sea ;) Enjoy!!!
We didn't climb up the lighthouse because it was foggy ;/
Maybe it's time to give up some of these warm soupy seas and come here to Poland, breath some fresh breeze... become lively and vigorous:) What is your opinion?
