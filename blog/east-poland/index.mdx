There is no doubt that some places in Poland are unforgettable, especially when it comes to natural landscapes and wilderness. If you fancy these kind of attractions, you’d better take your bike and visit Polish National Parks now. In this photoslide movie you will see some nice captures of animals and plant life. There are some cities and shrines too but in this region they seem very special and extraordinary. Our trip started in Lublin and we cycled south to Roztocze National Park. During cycling along we saw picturesque tiny houses which are rarity on the western side of Poland but there are loads of them in this part of our country. Most of them are made of resinous wood and although they’re old, they are in good condition. Abstraction occurs when you see a solar panel on the roofs of these old houses.
I do not want to go into details about our route because it was too many years ago. Better check the Green Velo 2000 km cycling trail that has been finshed recently and it offers you a perfectly safe and easy route to follow. There are also many informations about the attractions and accommodations. Definitely we will go there after we will come back from America and write a report:). Anyway, we finished our trip in Białowieski National Park where we saw a famous Polish animal(and beer) ŻUBR. Oh, just watch the photos…
