Another excellent ride from Williamsburg to Jamestown. I think everybody should see Colonial Williamsburg and compare it to NYC :) What a difference! It's a great live museum to visit and actors are the best. You can experience old times in every way, it is like back to the past. From Williamsburg we rode along the James River to Jamestown and we took a ferry to Surry. 
Nice watching :)
