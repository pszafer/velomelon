Our 2nd day in Patagonia riding through Lake District of Argentina. We rode a lot that day - 20 km ;) Amazing ride! We stopped near Villa la Angostura for camping because it was pretty place and no hurry. I like travelling like that, just take it easy :) Enjoy! I add English subtitles to every movie you can turn them on in the settings.
